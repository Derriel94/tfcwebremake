      content="Transforming Foundation Chucrch, We believe there is one eternally existing GOD who has three distinct persons: GOD the Father, GOD the Son, and GOD the Holy Spirit. He is the creator of all that exists, both visible and invisible, and is therefore worthy of all glory and praise. GOD is perfect in love, power, holiness, goodness, knowledge, wisdom, justice, and mercy. He is unchangeable and therefore is the same yesterday, today, and forever."
